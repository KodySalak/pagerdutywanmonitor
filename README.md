This was an easy way I found to monitor the WAN IP address and alert in PagerDuty if it differs from what you are expecting it to be, and auto resolves when the connection fails back to the primary IP.

Thanks to https://ifconfig.me for providing an easy way to grab the IP address of my WAN connection.
